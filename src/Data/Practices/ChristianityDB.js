    'Select a Scripture passage upon which to reflect' : 'Select a Scripture passage upon which to reflect. It could be the reading for the day, or you might choose to engage in this practice with a certain book of the Bible savoring brief parts of it each day.',
    'Read the passage' : 'The first time just get a feel for the passage. Preferably out loud, two or three times. When you read the passage a second time, note the word or phrase to which your attention is being drawn. It is God drawing your attention to this word or phrase. The divine has a special message just for you in this moment. If nothing stood out to you, read the passage a third time.',
    'Meditate on the word or phrase that stood out to you' : 'How is God speaking to you through this word or phrase? Is there an invitation? Is there a call? Does a memory surface? What image comes to mind? What feelings are evoked? Take your time and allow God to speak to you in the depths of your soul.',
    'Respond to God who has been speaking to you, in your prayer' : 'What is your response? What is your prayer? Allow your words to come from a place deep within where the Spirit dwells.',

    'Find a comfortable place to pray' : 'While some might prefer to pray while sitting on the floor or kneeling besides their bed, these are not your only options for meditation. If you are easily distracted while sitting still, you might want to practice meditation while walking or while sipping coffee. God meets us where we are — it doesn\'t have to be perfect. Just make sure you feel like you can be yourself with God in this place, whether you\'re alone or in public.',
    'Prepare your mind and heart for prayer' : 'Think about your prayer before you start praying.\nIs there something on my mind that I want to offer to God in prayer?\nThis will probably look different for you every day, and that is totally okay! Think about your relationships, work, and anything that is causing you anxiety, or you feel grateful for — God wants to hear it all! If your mind wanders in prayer, do not be afraid to return to this offering to God.\nAre there any distractions preventing me from resting with God?\nIt could be a physical distraction like dirty dishes or something on your to-do list. However, sometimes prayer makes the tasks in front of us seem less daunting. Discern how you can best set yourself up to rest in God\'s presence and listen to Him.\nCreate calm in preparation.\nTake some time to calm your heart, mind, and body before starting prayer. You might take a few deep breaths, silence your phone\'s notifications, or dim the lights if you\'re inside. Remember why you are settling into your Christian meditation practice — to grow closer with God in this prayer time.',
    'Select a prayer, verse, or word' : 'In your prayer and meditation practice, you can choose a prayer, verse, or word to focus on. The prayer can be personal or from your religious tradition, guiding your connection with the divine. A meaningful verse from a sacred text deepens your understanding and connection to your faith. Alternatively, selecting a significant word or phrase allows for contemplation and guides your thoughts and actions. These choices create a sacred space for reflection, connection, and growth in your relationship with God.',
    'Let God fill your heart' : 'As you engage in prayer and meditation, allow yourself to be open to God\'s presence and guidance. Invite Him to fill your heart with His love, wisdom, and peace. Surrender any worries, distractions, or burdens to Him, trusting that He will provide comfort and strength. Cultivate a sense of receptivity and surrender, allowing God to work in your life according to His divine plan.',
    'End your meditation with gratitude' : 'Finally, conclude your meditation practice with gratitude. Express your thanks to God for His presence, His blessings, and the opportunity to commune with Him. Recognize the transformative power of prayer and meditation in your life, and express gratitude for the insights, peace, and growth you have experienced. Carry this attitude of gratitude beyond your meditation practice and incorporate it into your daily life, fostering a deeper appreciation for all that you have been given.'
