Next, straighten your back and head, keeping your eyesight fixed on a point in front of you.\n\n6. Hold the position for the desired duration.',
    'Mayurasana - Peacock Pose': '1. Start in an upright seated position. Sit on your knees and heels in the Hero Pose (Virasana). Keeping some distance between your knees will open up your hips.\n\n2. Lean your shoulders forward and place your hands on the ground in front of you.

As you press your palms into the floor, your torso will press against the back of your upper arms. Your head will come forward towards the mat.\n\n4.

    'Uttana Kurmasana - Tortoise Pose': '1. Start by sitting on your yoga mat, knees knelt as your hips rest on your heels.\n\n2.

Now take a deep inhale as you bend down trying to touch your forehead to the ground.\n\n4. At this time, while you inhale you would feel your stomach sucking back in making it easier for you to bend down.\n\n5. Once done, now you can bring your arms all the way around to the back and clasp them. The posture indeed looks easy but now comes the difficult part, holding the posture for a few seconds, maybe a minute for the best.\n\n6. As you release your posture now exhale and continue with normal breathing until you reach your base one position.\n\n7. There is another variation to this tortoise pose as well where instead of you kneeling down you stretch your lower limbs ahead and then bend down in between your legs. This can be a bit more difficult and thus is reserved for the pros.',
    'Kurmasana - Tortoise Pose': '1. Sit in Dandasana with your legs straight in front of you and your hands on the floor alongside your hips. Press your thighs into the floor, flex your feet, and lift your chest. Bring your legs to the edges of the mat, with your knees as wide as your shoulders. Take a few breaths here.\n\n2. Bend your knees, and keep your feet flexed, bring them closer to your hips. Extend your chest and arms forward and down between your legs.\n\n3. Bend your legs even more, so that you can put your shoulders one by one under your knees. (If this is too difficult, continue to work on forward bends.) Once there, stretch your arms out to the sides. Roll your thighs inward and extend your inner heels, without creating tension in the feet. Spread the front of your chest and collarbones forward and down with the help of the pressure of your thighs on the shoulders or upper arms. Push your inner heels down and forward to stretch and straighten your legs. Your inner thighs should remain in contact with your side ribs.\n\n4. Inhale to continue to stretch your arms and chest out to your sides. Exhale to extend your spine farther forward. Do not force your legs; instead relax and exhale to release as far as you can into the pose. If you feel pain under your knees, take your arms slightly forward. Stay for a few breaths, then slowly come out of the pose. Repeat a few times.',
    'Padmasana - Lotus Pose': '1. Sit on the floor in Dandasana with your legs extended. Bend your right knee out to the side, and cradle your knee and your foot in your hands. Rotate your leg from the hip (not the knee) and guide your foot into your left hip crease.\n\n2. Bend your left knee, rotating the thigh outward from the hip and, just as you did on the right. Lift your shin slightly and guide the left foot over the right, and bring it to tuck into the right hip crease.\n\n3. Settle the tops of your feet against your upper thighs and release your knees towards the floor. Try not to let the ankles sickle.\n\n4. Sit up tall, lift your sternum and lengthen your spine. Sitting on a folded blanket may help keep the spine from rounding.\n\n5. Take slow, deep breaths and stay in the pose as long as it is comfortable.'
