    'Step 1' : 'find a quiet place where you will not be disturbed by outside noises. It\'s best to keep your phone away from you and sit in a place where you won\'t be interrupted by someone.',
    'Step 2' : 'you can choose to do this meditation standing up, sitting down with your legs crossed, or lying down. Just make sure you feel comfortable and relaxed. Start taking a few deep breaths and focusing on your breathing, continue to breathe deeply, and allow yourself to relax.',
    'Step 3' : 'now focus on each chakra from the bottom up. Always start with the root chakra and finish with the crown chakra. It may be obvious what blocked chakras are affecting you, or you may learn as you go through it.',
    'Step 4' : 'as you go through the seven chakras, imagine each as discs or lotus flowers. As you breathe in, visualize light glowing from the chakra you\'re focusing on. And as you breathe out, imagine all the stress flowing out of that chakra. If necessary, repeat this step on a chakra that still feels blocked; if not, move on to the next chakra.',
    'Step 5' : 'once you finish relieving the stress from each chakra, it\'s time to focus on aligning all seven of them. All your chakras should be spinning clockwise. To realign your chakras, it\'s important to meditate and visualize each chakra rotating clockwise.'
