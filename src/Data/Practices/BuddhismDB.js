const BreathDB = {
    'Take your seat': 'Sit cross-legged and upright on a meditation cushion or on a straight-backed chair with your feet flat on the floor. Try not to lean against the back of the chair.',
    'Find your sitting posture': 'Place your hands palms-down on your thighs and sit in an upright posture with a straight back — relaxed yet dignified. With your eyes open, let your gaze rest comfortably as you look slightly downward about six feet in front of you.',
    'Notice and follow your breath': 'Place your attention lightly on your out-breath, while remaining aware of your environment. Be with each breath as the air goes out through your mouth and nostrils and dissolves into the space around you.\n\nAt the end of each out-breath, simply rest until the next in-breath naturally begins. For a more focused meditation, you can follow both the out-breaths and in-breaths.',
    'Note the thoughts and feelings that arise': 'Whenever you notice that a thought, feeling, or perception has taken your attention away from the breath, just say to yourself, “thinking,” and return to following the breath. No need to judge yourself when this happens; just gently note it and attend to your breath and posture.',
    'End your session': 'After the allotted time, you can consider your meditation practice period over. But there\'s no need to give up any sense of calm, mindfulness, or openness you\'ve experienced. See if you can consciously allow these to remain present through the rest of your day.'

const WalkDB = {
    'Find an unobstructed space where you can walk in a straight line for about ten feet': 'Find an unobstructed space where you can walk in a straight line for about ten feet. This short walking distance is the instruction given in the Theravada tradition. Others prefer to walk for greater distances.',
    'Bring your attention down to your feet': 'Bring your attention down to your feet and slowly shift your weight from side to side and front to back. Being in bare feet can bring more awareness to what needs to happen in the body to create balance.',
    'Coming into physical stillness': 'Coming into physical stillness, lift the crown of your head up, slide your shoulders down and away from your ears, and lift your chest with dignity and pride, as if you were a king or a queen. You can clasp your hands behind your back, hold them in front of your body, or let your arms hang loosely to the side.',
    'Notice the weight redistribution in your body': 'Lifting your right leg, notice the weight redistribution in your body. Place your attention on what the left side of your body needs to do to hold your full weight—spreading the toes, engaging the core.',
    'Shift your weight forward': 'Extend the right leg forward, placing the heel on the ground and rolling onto the ball of the foot. As your weight shifts forward, notice how the heel of your left foot begins to lift.',

    'Flash On Bodhichitta': 'Rest your mind for a second or two in a state of openness or stillness. This stage is traditionally called flashing on absolute bodhichitta, awakened heart-mind, or opening to basic spaciousness and clarity.',
    'Begin The Visualization': 'Work with texture. Breathe in feelings of heat, darkness, and heaviness—a sense of claustrophobia—and breathe out feelings of coolness, brightness, and light—a sense of freshness. Breathe in completely, taking in negative energy through all the pores of your body. When you breathe out, radiate positive energy completely, through all the pores of your body. Do this until your visualization is synchronized with your in- and out-breaths.',
    'Focus On A Personal Situation': 'Focus on any painful situation that\'s real to you. Traditionally you begin by doing tonglen for someone you care about and wish to help. However, if you are stuck, you can do the practice for the pain you are feeling yourself, and simultaneously for all those who feel the same kind of suffering. For instance, if you are feeling inadequate, breathe that in for yourself and all the others in the same boat and send out confidence, adequacy, and relief in any form you wish.',
    'Expand Your Compassion': 'Finally, make the taking in and sending out bigger. If you are doing tonglen for someone you love, extend it out to all those who are in the same situation. If you are doing tonglen for someone you see on television or on the street, do it for all the others in the same boat. Make it bigger than just that one person. You can do tonglen for people you consider to be your enemies—those who hurt you or hurt others. Do tonglen for them, thinking of them as having the same confusion and stuckness as your friend or yourself. Breathe in their pain and send them relief.'

    'Sit comfortably': 'Sit comfortably, in a chair or on a meditation cushion. Allow your body to feel at ease and supported by the surface beneath you. Begin to connect to your breath, focusing on the inhale and exhale until your breath finds a natural flow.',
    'Bring your attention to your heart area': 'Bring your attention to your heart area. You may wish to bring a hand to your heart, or leave them comfortably rested on your knees. Begin to offer loving-kindness to yourself by repeating these phrases, allowing ample space between each one:\nMay I be safe\nMay I be healthy\nMay I be happy\nMay I be at ease\nMay I be filled with loving-kindness\nMay I be peaceful',
    'Think of someone you love': 'Next, think of someone you love and care about. This can be a family member, friend, a pet, or someone helpful in your life. Picture them in your mind, and offer them the same phrases of loving-kindness:\nMay I be safe\nMay you be healthy\nMay you be happy\nMay you be at ease\nMay you be filled with loving-kindness\nMay you be peaceful',
    'Focus to the rhythm of your breath': 'If you find your mind wandering, return to the rhythm of your breath. Next, call to mind a person you consider difficult. This could be someone you\'ve had a disagreement with, or any sort of difficulty with. If this feels too painful at first, send yourself the loving-kindness you need. Imagine this person in your mind, and allow your heart to soften toward them by repeating the phrases again:\nMay all beings be safe\nMay they be healthy\nMay they be happy\nMay they be at ease\nMay they be filled with\nloving-kindness\nMay all beings be peaceful'
